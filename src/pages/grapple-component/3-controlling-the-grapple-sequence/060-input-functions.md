## Concept

Input Functions on the Grapple Component are functions that are specifically meant for user input. Most commonly, they are used to control Grapple Sequences from their [Grapple Component](/grapple-component/1-overview-of-the-grapple-component/links-between). They can also be used on any Grapple Component for other functionality that is not tied to a Grapple Sequence.

Most input functions include parameters that determine their Replication Mode and Timestamp.
