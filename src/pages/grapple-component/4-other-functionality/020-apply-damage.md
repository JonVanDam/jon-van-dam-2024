Damage can be dealt through the Grapple Component. This can be done using function <span class="object">Apply Damage from Grapple Component</span>, which can be called from any Blueprint on the Grapple Component that is inflicting the damage.

It is suggested to use a [Queued Event](/grapple-component/4-other-functionality/040-queued-events) to apply damage, as illustrated below.
