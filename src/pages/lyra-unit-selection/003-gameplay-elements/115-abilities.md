Units can have their own unique ability sets.

To add abilities, gameplay effects or attributes to a unit, open the Equipment Definition for your unit *(<span class="object">EQD_MyUnit</span>)*, and modify the <span class="variable">Ability Sets To Grant</span> variable.  

<div class="note">This functionality is not unique to the plugin, but part of the equipment system in Lyra. For more information on ability sets, please consult the <a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/abilities-in-lyra-in-unreal-engine">documentation on gameplay abilities in Lyra</a>.</div>
