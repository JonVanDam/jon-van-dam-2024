**The easiest way to get started with the plugin, is to enable the content examples, and modify these files to the needs of your project.**

To do this, enable the *LyraUnitSelectionSample* plugin.

The content folder of the plugin contains a <span class="object">Game Feature Data</span> asset with the same name as the plugin.

Enable this game feature by setting its <span class="variable">Current State</span> to *Active*.
