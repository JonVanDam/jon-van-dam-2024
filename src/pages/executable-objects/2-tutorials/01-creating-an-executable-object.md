Executable Objects represent an action that will happen in the game world. They can be customized with their own inputs and outputs, both in the form of parameters and executions. All of this functionality is condensed into a single Blueprint node.

## What can they do?

You can use Executable Objects to build your own custom actions that happen over time. Some examples are:

* Gradually Updating Variables
* Moving an object from one place to another
* Abilities
* Status Effects
* Updating velocity (e.g. 'push' or 'dash' mechanics)
* Interactions(e.g. healing animations, throws, executions, ...)
