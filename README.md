# Jon Van Dam

This is the UI repository for the new 2024 version of the JonVanDam website.

## Content Management

Inside of this Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files necessary for content management:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ assets/
|       â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ ...
```

All documentation content will be kept in the `src/pages/` folder.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `src/assets/` directory.

It is very important to keep clear of the `layouts/`, `styles/`, `scripts/` and `components/` directories when not making any UI changes.

## Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command       | Action                                     |
| :------------ | :----------------------------------------- |
| `npm install` | Installs dependencies                      |
| `npm run dev` | Start local dev server at `localhost:4321` |
